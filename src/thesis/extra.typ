This master thesis has been developed exclusively using open-source tools.
Similar to an open-source project, it was maintained in a private `git`
repository #cite(<PolMasterThesis>, form: "normal"). That repository will be made
public after the oral defense and necessary internal cleanup. Automated and
reproducible builds were managed via GitHub Actions
#cite(<ghActions>, form: "normal"), ensuring that a new compiled version was
published at each commit to the project. Additionally, I'm planning to publish
it on Zenodo #cite(<Zenodo>, form: "normal") after the necessary formalities are
completed.

For the purpose of the @chapter3, an open-source project
#cite(<r13yBuildScenarios>, form: "normal") was created to provide a full
transparency on the results shown in that chapter.
