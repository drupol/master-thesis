  abstract = {Despite the growing acknowledgment of reproducibility crisis in computational science, there is still a lack of clarity around what exactly constitutes a reproducible or replicable study in many computational fields, including environmental modelling. To this end, we put forth a taxonomy that defines an environmental modelling study as being either 1) repeatable, 2) runnable, 3) reproducible, or 4) replicable. We introduce these terms with illustrative examples from hydrology using a hydrologic modelling framework along with cyberinfrastructure aimed at fostering reproducibility. Using this taxonomy as a guide, we argue that containerization is an important but lacking component needed to achieve the goal of computational reproducibility in hydrology and environmental modelling. Examples from hydrology are provided to demonstrate how new tools, including a user-friendly tool for containerization of computational analyses called Sciunit, can lower the barrier to reproducibility and replicability in the environmental modelling community.}

  abstract  = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery.\nConcerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.\nReproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.}

However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether today’s computational work is adequately reproducible. In principle, it should be possible to specify a computation to sufficient detail that anyone should be able to reproduce it exactly. But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

  abstract = {The Internet has become an important part of our lives and an increasing number of researchers use eye-tracking technology to examine attention and behavior in online environments. Researchers, however, face a significant challenge in mapping eye-tracking data from scrollable web pages. We describe the R package eyeScrollR for mapping eye-tracking data from scrollable content such as web pages. The package re-maps eye-tracking gaze coordinates to full-page coordinates with a deterministic algorithm based on mouse scroll data. The package includes options for handling common situations, such as sticky menus or ads that remain visible when the user scrolls. We test the package's validity in different hardware and software settings and on different web pages and show that it is highly accurate when tested against manual coding. Compared to current methods, eyeScrollR provides a more reproducible and reliable approach for mapping eye-tracking data from scrollable web pages. With its open code and free availability, we recommend eyeScrollR as an essential tool for eye-tracking researchers, particularly those who adhere to open-science principles. The eyeScrollR package offers a valuable contribution to the field of eye-tracking research, facilitating accurate and standardized analysis of eye-tracking data in web scrolling contexts.}

HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system---software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing among researchers with representative use cases.},

  abstract = {Tests that fail inconsistently, without changes to the code under test, are described as flaky. Flaky tests do not give a clear indication of the presence of software bugs and thus limit the reliability of the test suites that contain them. A recent survey of software developers found that 59\% claimed to deal with flaky tests on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. As well as being detrimental to developers, flaky tests have also been shown to limit the applicability of useful techniques in software testing research. In general, one can think of flaky tests as being a threat to the validity of any methodology that assumes the outcome of a test only depends on the source code it covers. In this article, we systematically survey the body of literature relevant to flaky test research, amounting to 76 papers. We split our analysis into four parts: addressing the causes of flaky tests, their costs and consequences, detection strategies, and approaches for their mitigation and repair. Our findings and their implications have consequences for how the software-testing community deals with test flakiness, pertinent to practitioners and of interest to those wanting to familiarize themselves with the research area.},

This generational change is emphasized and explored with updated content featuring tablet computers, cloud infrastructure, and the ARM (mobile computing devices) and x86 (cloud computing) architectures. Because an understanding of modern hardware is essential to achieving good performance and energy efficiency, this edition adds a new concrete example, "Going Faster," used throughout the text to demonstrate extremely effective optimization techniques. Also new to this edition is discussion of the "Eight Great Ideas" of computer architecture. As with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Instructors looking for4th Edition teaching materials should e-mail textbook@elsevier.com. Includes new examples, exercises, and material highlighting the emergence of mobile computing and the Cloud. Covers parallelism in depth with examples and content highlighting parallel hardware and software topics Features the Intel Core i7, ARM Cortex-A8 and NVIDIA Fermi GPU as real-world examples throughout the book Adds a new concrete example, "Going Faster," to demonstrate how understanding hardware can inspire software optimizations that improve performance by 200 times. Discusses and highlights the "Eight Great Ideas" of computer architecture: Performance via Parallelism; Performance via Pipelining; Performance via Prediction; Design for Moore's Law; Hierarchy of Memories; Abstraction to Simplify Design; Make the Common Case Fast; and Dependability via Redundancy. Includes a full set of updated and improved exercises.}
