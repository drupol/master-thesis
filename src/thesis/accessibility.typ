This master thesis has been written with a focus on accessibility to ensure it
can be easily read and understood by a diverse audience, including individuals
with disabilities. The following measures have been taken to enhance
accessibility:

- Links: all hyperlinks within this document are underlined and clearly
  distinguishable from regular text. This visual cue helps users identify
  clickable links easily.

  consistently throughout the document to aid comprehension. Mathematical
  symbols, special characters, and other notation are presented in a clear and
  readable manner.

- Text formatting: the document uses high-contrast text formatting and font
  sizes that are readable across different devices and screen resolutions. The
  `New Computer Modern` #cite(<NewComputerModern>, form: "normal") font is used,
  chosen for its clarity and readability, especially in mathematical and
  technical contexts.

- Margins: the margins have been alternately adapted to ensure that when the
  document is printed, it is suitable for binding and easy to read. This
  consideration enhances the physical accessibility of the printed document.

- Headings and structure: the document is structured with clear headings and
  subheadings to facilitate navigation. This hierarchical organisation assists

  most common abbreviations used throughout the document. This aids readers in
  quickly understanding the abbreviations and acronyms, improving overall
  comprehension. Additionally, comprehensive lists of
  #link(<list-of-definitions>)[definitions], #link(<list-of-figures>)[figures],
  and #link(<list-of-tables>)[tables] are provided.

- Accessible file formats: the document is available in multiple file formats,
  to accommodate various reading preferences and assistive technologies.

- Bibliography links: in line with the #gls("IEEE") citation style, numbers in
  brackets are used to link references in the
  #link(<bibliography>)[bibliography]. This method provides a clear and
  consistent way to reference sources, enhancing the readability and
