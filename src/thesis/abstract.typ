  The concept of reproducibility has long been a cornerstone in scientific
  research, ensuring that results are robust, repeatable, and can be
  independently verified. This concept has been extended to computer science,
  focusing on the ability to recreate identical software artefacts. However, the
  importance of reproducibility in software engineering is often overlooked,
  leading to challenges in the validation, security, and reliability of software
  products.

  This master's thesis aims to investigate the current state of reproducibility
  in software engineering, exploring both the barriers and potential solutions
  to making software more reproducible and raising awareness. It identifies key
  factors that impede reproducibility such as inconsistent environments, lack of
  standardisation, and incomplete documentation. To tackle these issues, I
  propose an empirical comparison of tools facilitating software
  reproducibility.

  To provide a comprehensive assessment of reproducibility in software
  engineering, this study adopts a methodology that involves a hands-on
  evaluation of four different methods and tools. Through a systematic
  evaluation of these tools, this research seeks to determine their
  effectiveness in establishing and maintaining identical software environments
  and builds.

  This study contributes to academic knowledge and offers practical insights
  that could influence future software development protocols and standards.
