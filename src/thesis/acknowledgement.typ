#acknowledgement[
  First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor
  Tom Mens. I am incredibly thankful for his availability and guidance
  throughout my studies. It was a great honour to receive his proposal to
  supervise my research in my final year. Beyond that, he generously
  allowed me to suggest topics that piqued my interest, ultimately enabling me
  to focus on a subject that I am truly passionate about.

  I must also express my heartfelt appreciation for my girlfriend, Sandra. Her
  endless patience and emotional support have been a constant source of
  strength, motivation and inspiration for me. However, it is with a touch of
  melancholy that I acknowledge the sacrifices we have made in our personal
  lives in order to pursue this overdue academic endeavour that I should have
  completed twenty years ago.

  I would like to thank my family and #emph[in-real-life] friends for their
  continuous support and encouragement throughout these last years. Your belief
  in me has provided the foundation upon which this work stands. I am also
  deeply grateful to my #emph[online] friends, especially within the Typst and
  Nix communities, for their tremendous support and constant source of
  solutions, inspiration and motivation.

  A special mention is deserved for Izumi, my cat, who was a constant companion
  and source of comfort over the last decade. His loss was a profound sorrow,
  and I deeply miss his presence. The memories of the countless hours he spent
  by my side, offering silent support during my work, have left an indelible
  mark.

  Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the participants in
  this research. I am particularly grateful to my colleagues at European
  Commission, who courageously and continuously supported me while remaining
  unaware of my academic activities. Your valuable feedback has greatly
  contributed to the development of some parts of this master's thesis. In fact,
  your lack of awareness helped me understand the barriers to implementing
  software reproducibility from the very beginning and in a real professional
  context. Each piece of feedback has been instrumental in helping me better
  understand and improve communication about this concept.
